## 💡 What is this?
UW CalcArchive is a test question bank built for UW MATH 124/5/6 students practicing for midterms and finals.

Everyone (hopefully) knows the UW Math Department provides archives of past tests. But who wants to take practice test after practice test praying you encounter relevant questions? It's better to focus your time and energy on the types of problems that stump you.

This archive lets your search for specific types of test questions. The questions are real with answers from the key, no AI slop. Just select what class you're in and the topic you want to practice—then, start grinding. 😤

## 🚧 Roadmap
*Work in progress!*
- [ ] Compile a list of all MATH 12x test archive pages on professor sites or on the official UW Math Department test archives.
- [ ] Capture image pairs of every question and their answer. Store in a cloud-hosted database.
- [ ] Tune an image classification model to provide tags for each question. Add tags as metadata to the questions in the database.
- [ ] Build and deploy an API to handle queries and return relevant questions.
- [ ] Mock up the web app UI on Figma.
- [ ] Build and deploy a web app as the front-end of the database.
- [ ] (Maybe) Add a system to handle complaints (i.e. mistagged questions, incorrect answer key).
- [ ] (Maybe) Add user authentication to the web app.
